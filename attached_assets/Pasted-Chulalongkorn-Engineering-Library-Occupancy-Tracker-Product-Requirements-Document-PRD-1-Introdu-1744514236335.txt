Chulalongkorn Engineering Library Occupancy Tracker
Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the Chulalongkorn Engineering Library Occupancy Tracker, a web and mobile application designed to provide real-time information about library occupancy, historical usage patterns, and a social platform for students to share seating availability.

1.2 Problem Statement
At Chulalongkorn University, students must scan their ID cards to enter the Engineering Library, but there is currently no system to monitor real-time occupancy or seat availability. Students often waste time searching for available seats, especially during peak periods, and have no way to plan their library visits efficiently.

1.3 Project Goals
Create a real-time occupancy tracking system that leverages the existing ID scan infrastructure
Provide analytical insights into library usage patterns
Develop a social platform for students to share seat availability and duration of use
Improve the overall library experience for students
Create a scalable solution that could potentially be adopted by other university facilities
2. User Personas
2.1 Regular Student
Name: Somchai
Description: Undergraduate engineering student who visits the library frequently to study.
Goals: Find available seating quickly, plan library visits during less crowded times, connect with friends studying in the library.
Pain Points: Wastes time looking for seats, arrives at fully occupied library, difficulty finding suitable study spaces.

2.2 Group Project Team
Name: Design Team
Description: A group of 3-4 students working together on assignments and projects.
Goals: Find adjacent seating for the whole group, reserve or claim space for extended work sessions.
Pain Points: Difficult to find enough adjacent seats, uncertainty about how long current occupants will stay.

2.3 Library Staff
Name: Librarian Apinya
Description: Staff member responsible for library operations and resource management.
Goals: Understand usage patterns, improve resource allocation, ensure safety regulations compliance.
Pain Points: No data on peak hours, difficulty in planning staffing, no insights for improvement decisions.
